# ForexReplay

A forex bar-replay and backtesting tool for EURUSD. Owner: Jeevesh Prakash (GitHub `Jeevesh692/ForexReplay`, branch `main`).

- **v1** (`forex_replay/`): Python package. Matplotlib replay, event-driven backtest, journal CSV, R-multiple stats.
- **v2** (`web/`): a TradingView-style browser app in plain JavaScript modules, served by a small Python server. This is what is being built now, to a day-by-day plan in `docs/plan.md`.

The project is also a portfolio piece for AI-engineering applications: "a complex app built with an AI agent, directed and understood by me". So the record of who decided what matters as much as the code. Keep it honest.

## How Jeevesh works with you

- He says "start day N". Do that day from `docs/plan.md`, end to end, then report.
- He is a self-taught programmer and trades this strategy himself. Explain in plain words; no jargon without a one-line meaning.
- Never state a number you have not just read or computed. If something was not checked, say so.
- Ask only when a wrong guess would be expensive. Otherwise decide, and say what you decided.

## The daily routine (do all of it, every day)

1. Build the day's features with tests.
2. Run both test suites (below). Check the app in a real browser, not only in tests.
3. Add a day entry to `docs/build-log.md` in the existing format: asked for, built, tests, decisions, found along the way, how to check.
4. If a design choice was made, add `docs/decisions/NNNN-title.md` in the existing format (date, status, decided by, reasoning, not yet done).
5. Update the "So far" line near the top of `README.md` and the status table in `docs/plan.md`.
6. Commit as `v2 day N: summary` with a bullet list, then push to `origin main` without asking (Jeevesh's standing instruction, 3 Oct 2026). Leave `strategies/impulse_candle/trades.csv` uncommitted (his own test trades).
7. Finish with: what was built, how to check it by hand, how you know it is right, a short walkthrough of the ideas, and **three questions** that test whether he understood the day. Grade his answers honestly next time.

## Run and test

```
python -m forex_replay app          # or double-click start_app.bat; serves http://127.0.0.1:8765
python -m pytest                    # Python tests (pip install pytest)
node --test web/tests/*.test.mjs    # JavaScript tests (needs Node.js; check `node --version`)
python -m forex_replay.golden       # regenerate the engine comparison fixture (only when engine rules change)
python -m forex_replay.stats_golden # regenerate the statistics comparison fixture (only when stats.py changes)
```

Expected today: 64 Python tests, 105 JavaScript tests, all passing.

## Rules that must not be broken

- **No look-ahead.** The chart and the engine may only ever see candles the replay clock has revealed. Orders, closes and stop moves are accepted only at the live edge of the replay.
- **One replay clock** (`web/js/replay.js`): one position in M5 candles; every timeframe is derived from it.
- **Fills are resolved on M5 candles** whatever timeframe is on screen. An order is never evaluated on the candle it was placed on.
- **Two engines, one truth.** `forex_replay/broker.py` and `web/js/broker.js` implement the same rules. Change Python first, then JavaScript, then run `python -m forex_replay.golden`; the JavaScript parity test must match every recorded trade.
- **Prices are whole points** in the browser (1.08500 is 108500). Lot sizes are whole numbers of 0.01 lots. No floats for either.
- **Times are UTC seconds everywhere.** India time (+5:30) is applied only inside `web/js/chart.js` and `web/js/time.js`. MT5 server time is New York + 7 hours; conversion is in `forex_replay/datapipe.py`.
- **The engine knows prices and R; money lives in `web/js/account.js`.**
- **One set of statistics.** `forex_replay/stats.py` defines them; `web/js/analytics.js` must match `web/tests/fixtures/stats_golden.json`.
- **Drawings are anchored in time and price**, never pixels or candle numbers.
- **No build step, no npm packages.** Plain ES modules. The only third-party code is TradingView Lightweight Charts v5 (Apache 2.0) in `web/vendor/`, downloaded on first run; keep `attributionLogo: true`.
- `web/data/` and `web/vendor/` are generated and gitignored. Never commit them.

Read `docs/decisions/` before changing how something works; each record says why it is the way it is.

## Facts about the data and account

- Data: EURUSD M5 only, 1 Aug 2025 to 11 Sep 2026, exported from MT5 into `data/`. M1 was not wanted at the start.
- The export records zero spread on about 95% of candles. Commission is $4 per lot (his broker's figure; treated as round turn, not yet confirmed whether it is per side).
- Chart clock is India time.
