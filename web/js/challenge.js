// Prop-firm challenge mode: a profit target, a daily loss limit and a maximum loss.
//
// The rules (the common two-step challenge model):
//  * Profit target: PASSED when the balance (closed results) reaches the starting
//    balance + target %, with no trade still open.
//  * Daily loss: FAILED when equity falls more than daily % of the STARTING balance
//    below the balance the day started with.
//  * Maximum loss: FAILED when equity falls below the starting balance - max %.
//    The floor is fixed (static); it does not trail the highest balance.
//  * A day starts at the broker server's midnight (17:00 New York), the same
//    boundary as the D1 candle and as MT5-based prop firms.
//
// How it is measured, honestly at M5 detail:
//  * After the engine has processed each M5 candle, equity is worked out at the
//    worst price of that candle for every open trade (the low for a buy, the high
//    plus spread for a sell), as if all of them were at their worst at once. The
//    order of prices inside a candle is unknown, so this is the conservative
//    assumption, like "stop loss first" in the engine.
//  * "Below" means strictly below: touching the limit exactly is not a breach.
//  * On a breach, every open trade is closed at that candle's close and pending
//    orders are cancelled; on a pass, pending orders are cancelled. Either way no
//    more trading in that run. A real firm closes at the moment of the breach,
//    which an M5 candle cannot pin down; the close of the candle is used instead.
//
// This file knows dollars only through numbers it is given; trading.js feeds it.
